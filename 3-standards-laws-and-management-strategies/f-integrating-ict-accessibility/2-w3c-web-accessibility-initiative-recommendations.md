* Assign responsibilities
* Determine budget and resources
* Review environment

* Integrate goals into policies
* Assign tasks and support delivery
* Evaluate early and regularly
* Prioritize issues

## 4. Sustain

Regular reviews of content, organizational processes, and resources will help ensure that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified. Developing a management reporting process will help ensure that it is clear where activity is required for follow-up work.
