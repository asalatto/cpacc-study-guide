# Procurement Processes

Purchasing ICT solutions that are usable by everyone in your organization and by your customers is a key component of an ICT accessibility program. Products that are designed for universal use cost less over time since they do not require adaptation or redesign.

Best practices include:

* Verifying product accessibility claims
* Verifying a vendor’s accessibility expertise and capacity
* Requiring product accessibility in contractual agreements
* Periodically reviewing a vendor’s product accessibility roadmap for adherence
* Leveraging the organization’s procurement policies and requirements to influence vendors
