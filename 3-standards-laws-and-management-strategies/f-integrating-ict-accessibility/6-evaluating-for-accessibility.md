# Evaluating for Accessibility

The W3C recommends evaluating early and throughout the design and development process. It is easier and less costly to find and address accessibility issues early.

* Ensure the product or service is fit for its purpose.
* Design for usability by people with disabilities.
* Use a born accessible approach to design.
* Create reusable design and code libraries that help developers code for accessibility.
* Use quality assurance tools, methods, and protocols including accessibility evaluation tools. Automated checkers only catch about 25% of defects. Human evaluation is critical to ensuring the product or service created is accessible.
* Perform formative, summative, and continuous evaluations. Test throughout the project lifecycle and any time new content is added or code is updated.
* Include people with disabilities in evaluations.
* If there are gaps in your organizationâ€™s capabilities, use outside expert analysis and consultation until you build up in-house expertise.
