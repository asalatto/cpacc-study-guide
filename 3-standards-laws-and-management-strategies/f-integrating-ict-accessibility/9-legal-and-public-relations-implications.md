# Legal & Public Relations Implications

Organizations may have legal obligations to ensure their products and services, and information about them, are accessible to people with disabilities. Prioritizing accessibility can also bolster positive public relations and reputation.

In a large organization, public relations staff should consult with legal or risk and compliance before publishing accessibility information about the organization.

In small organizations, people in roles of responsibility should seek guidance from laws and policies.

* Become familiar with relevant standards and laws
* Assess your organizationâ€™s legal liability
* Ensure the organization has and is following an ICT accessibility plan
* Ensure the plan includes documenting how products and services meet accessibility standards
* Capitalize on the positive public relations that accessibility brings to your organization
