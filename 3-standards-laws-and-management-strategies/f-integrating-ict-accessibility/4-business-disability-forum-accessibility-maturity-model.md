# Business Disability Forum's Accessibility Maturity Model

The Business Disability Forum’s Technology Taskforce developed the **Accessibility Maturity Model** as a self-assessment tool to help organizations benchmark their progress in all aspects of accessibility.

Organizations make a public commitment to accessibility when they sign the Charter. An organization assesses its progress on a scale of 1 – 5:

1. Informal. No documentation or process in place.
2. Defined. Documented but not actioned or completed once.
3. Repeatable. Process established and actioned consistently.
4. Managed. Process monitored and improved; business as usual.
5. Best practice. Innovate, improve, and share.
