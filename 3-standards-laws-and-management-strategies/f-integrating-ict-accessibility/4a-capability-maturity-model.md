# The Capability Maturity Model for Software

The Capability Maturity Model, developed by Carnegie Mellon University, is an IT process improvement model that was initially designed for software development. Version 1.1 is adapted here to ICT accessibility:

## Maturity Levels

### Initial

* The organization typically does not provide a stable environment for developing and maintaining accessible products, service, and information.

### Repeatable

* Policies are in place for managing projects and procedures for ICT accessibility.
* Processes can be characterized as:
    * Practiced
    * Documented
    * Enforced
    * Trained
    * Measured
    * Able to improve

### Defined

* Standard processes for developing and maintaining ICT accessibility across the organization are documented, and these processes are integrated into a coherent whole.
* Processes are used, and changed as appropriate, to help the staff perform more effectively.

### Managed

* The organization sets quantitative quality goals for products and processes.
* Processes include well-defined and consistent measurements.

### Optimizing

* The entire organization is focused on continuous process improvement.
* The organization identifies weaknesses and strengthens the process proactively, with the goal of preventing the occurrence of defects.
* Innovations that exploit best practices are identified and transferred throughout the organization.
