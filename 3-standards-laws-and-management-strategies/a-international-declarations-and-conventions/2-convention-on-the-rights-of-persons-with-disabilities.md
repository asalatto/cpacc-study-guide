# The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities

**When**: December 13, 2006
**Where**: New York, New York, USA
**Who**: United Nations General Assembly

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) of 2006 is the first binding international human rights instrument that specifically protects the rights of people with disabilities. States that ratify (accept) the agreement must take steps to implement those rights.

The Convention is the first binding international human rights instrument that specifically addresses the
rights of people with disabilities. It shifts focus from people with disabilities as "objects" of charity and medical/social protection, to "subjects" with rights, who are capable of claiming those rights and making decisions for their own lives.

## Article 9 of the CRPD: Accessibility

Article 9 of the CRPD seeks to "enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life" and calls for member states to provide access on equal basis with others to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications.
