# International Declarations and Conventions on Disability Rights

**Goal**: Explain the main purpose and protections of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and name the most prominent international declarations and conventions that protect human rights and the rights of people with disabilities.

**Legal instruments** can address the rights of people with disabilities at different levels. They may:

* Grant fundamental or human rights to every person.
* Prohibit discrimination based on disability.
* Directly address the rights of people with disabilities.

The 1999 Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities provides a clear definition of disability discrimination:

"The term ‘discrimination against persons with disabilities’ means any distinction, exclusion, or restriction based on a disability, record of disability, condition resulting from a previous disability, or perception of disability, whether present or past, which has the effect or objective of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise by a person with a disability of his or her human rights and fundamental freedoms."
