# The Fundamental Rights of the European Union

## Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was declared in 2000, and came into force in 2009. It sets out the full range of civil, political, economic, and social rights of everyone living in the EU. Its aim was to bring consistency and clarity to the rights established at different times and in different ways in the individual EU Member States. 

### Article 21: Non-Discrimination

Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

### Article 26: Integration of Persons with Disabilities

The Union recognizes and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration, and participation in the life of the community.

## Employment Equality Directive

Adopted by the EU in 2000, this prohibits disability discrimination in employment and occupation. It requires reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities to guarantee equal treatment.

## Anti-Discrimination Directive

In 2008, a general anti-discrimination directive was proposed to implement the principle of equal treatment outside the labour market, but it has not been adopted. The general anti-discrimination or disability equality legislation differs in content and approach from country to country.
