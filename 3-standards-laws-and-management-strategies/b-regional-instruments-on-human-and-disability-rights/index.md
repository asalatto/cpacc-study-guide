# Regional Instruments on Human and Disability Rights

**Goal**: Understand how prominent regional, national, and domain-specific instruments protect people with disabilities,
and explain the main purposes of each.

Civil rights protections for people with disabilities have become more common since the 1990s, starting with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. This provided the model for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In Europe, thirty-three countries have adopted some form of disability equality protections.

This also marks a shift from the medical to the social model of disability, with the burden shifting to social institutions and government.

## Legal Approaches

The law has two approaches to granting rights to or accommodating the needs of people with disabilities in practice: reasonable accommodation (also called individual accommodation) and accessibility.

**Reasonable accomodation** aims to ensure equal treatment on a case by case basis.

**Accessibility** aims to meet conditions or requirements regardless of a person's disability status.
