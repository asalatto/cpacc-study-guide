# The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights

Adopted in 1981, the African Charter on Human and People's Rights recognizes the rights of all people. It does not specifically mention people with disabilities, but its provisions have been used to provide equal protection to those with disabilities. 

## African Disability Rights Protocol (ADRP)

In 2018, the African Union adopted a protocol to the Charter that focuses on safeguarding the human rights of people with disabilities. It adds details to the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) such as providing specific provisions about armed conflicts and forced displacements, providing more extensive provisions on harmful practices, and listing some of the most common ones.

As of mid-2023, the ADRP had not yet reached the 15 ratifications necessary for it to come into force.

### Article 8(1) of the CRPD

States Parties undertake to adopt immediate, effective and appropriate measures […] to combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on sex and age, in all areas of life.

### Article 11(1) of the ARPD

State Parties shall take all appropriate measures and offer appropriate support and assistance to victims of harmful practices, including legal sanctions, educational and advocacy campaigns, to eliminate harmful practices perpetrated on persons with disabilities, including witchcraft, abandonment, concealment, ritual killings or the association of disability with omens.
