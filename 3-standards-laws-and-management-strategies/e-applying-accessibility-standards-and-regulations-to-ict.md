# Applying Accessibility Standards and Regulations to ICT

**Goal**: Name prominent examples of accessibility laws and regulations applied to Information Communication Technology (ICT) and identify the main enforcement mechanisms of each.

## US Laws and Standards

### Section 508

In the United States, federal, state, and local government websites must meet Section 508. The 508 standard uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 as the conformance standard.

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Although the ADA doesn't specify legal standards for website accessibility, businesses and other organizations can be sued for lack of accessibility.

The ADA is enforced by the US Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division. In cases involving educational institutions, it is enforced by the US Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights.

* **Title II** protects people with disabilities from discrimination in public places, including state and local government spaces and websites.
* **Title III** prohibits discrimination based on disability in private places that welcome the public, including e-commerce, organizational websites, and public mobile applications.

## EU Laws and Standards

### Web Accessibility Directive

The European Union Web Accessibility Directive 2016 / 2102, which took effect in September 2018, establishes the accessibility standard rules that all public sector ICT must follow. The Directive refers to the EN 301 549 standards, which align with WCAG 2.1.

The Directive covers:

* Websites, applications, and mobile apps
* Downloadable documents
* Biometrics
* Two-way voice communication
* Accessibility documentation and support services

### European Accessibility Act

Passed by the European Commission in June 2019, the European Accessibility Act covers products and services identified as most important for people with disabilities. These include:

* Computers and operating systems
* ATMs
* Ticketing and check-in machines
* Smartphones
* TV equipment related to digital television services
* Telephony services and related equipment
* Access to audio-visual media services such as television broadcast and related consumer equipment
* Services related to air, bus, rail, and waterborne passenger transport
* Banking services
* E-books
* E-commerce

## VPAT Accessibility Conformance Report

The VPAT, or Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, is a template for documenting how well a product conforms to (meets) accessibility standards. 

In the same way organizations require information security compliance reports, many require a VPAT as part of their procurement process. Organizations may also require a detailed accessibility roadmap that describes how and by when the product will meet standards.

The VPAT template provides columns for:

* Recording conformance to a relevant standard or guideline (WCAG, EN 301 549, Revised Section 508)
* Documenting the level of conformance:
    * Supports
    * Partially supports
    * Does not support
    * Not applicable
* Providing a detailed explanation for how the product meets or doesn't meet the standard or guidelines
