# Procurement Laws

Procurement laws help ensure that governments procure accessible products and services. The laws include the accessibility standards that products and services should meet.

## European Union Procurement Laws

* The **EU Public Procurement Directives** declare that technical specifications must take into account accessibility, and can exclude economic operators which have violated social obligations including accessibility.

* **EN 301 549** lays out accessibility requirements for ICT products and services in government agencies across the European Union.

## US Procurement Laws

* **Section 508** of the Rehabilitation Act requires accessibility for federal employees and for ICT developed, procured, maintained, or used by US federal agencies. It uses WCAG criteria.
