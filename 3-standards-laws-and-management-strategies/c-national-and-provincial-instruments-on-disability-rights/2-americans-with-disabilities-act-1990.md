# The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a US national civil rights law that puts in place protections for people with disabilities, similar to those provided on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. 

It guarantees equal opportunities for people with disabilities in:

* public accommodations
* employment
* transportation
* state and local government services
* telecommunications

The Findings of Chapter 126, Equal Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities, state:
* Disability doesn't diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but they have often been excluded or discriminated against
* Historically, persons with disabilities have been segregated and isolated, and this is still a problem today
* Discrimination persists in important areas like employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services.
* Individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination
* National census data has shown that people with disabilities are disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally
* the Nationâ€™s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self- sufficiency for such individuals
* Continued discrimination costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and non-productivity
