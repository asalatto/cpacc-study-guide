# National and Provincial Instruments on Disability Rights

Civil rights protections for people with disabilities have spread rapidly across many countries since the 1990s. The move from the medical to the social model of disability is a main driver of the legal shift from a welfare or social security law model towards anti-discrimination or equality law. The other pivotal driver to the integration of disability rights in law in many countries is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
