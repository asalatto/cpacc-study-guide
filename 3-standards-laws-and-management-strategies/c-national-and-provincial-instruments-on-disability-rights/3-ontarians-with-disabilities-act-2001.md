# The Ontarians with Disabilities Act of 2001

The Ontarian Human Rights Code contains the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) and the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR).

The AODA ensures the rights of people with disabilities in the Canadian province of Ontario to equal opportunities and to be free from discrimination. The goal is for Ontario to be accessible by 2025.

These regulations exist under the AODA through the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR):

* Customer Service Standard
* Information and Communications Standard
* Employment Standard
