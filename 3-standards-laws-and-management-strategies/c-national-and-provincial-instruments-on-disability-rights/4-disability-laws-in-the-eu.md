# Disability Laws in the EU

In 2000, the European Union adopted the Employment Equality Directive, that prohibits disability discrimination in employment and occupation (as well as discrimination on some other grounds). The directive requires reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities to guarantee equal treatment. 

A general Anti-discrimination Directive was proposed in 2008 that would implement the principle of equal treatment outside the labour market, but it has not been adopted.
