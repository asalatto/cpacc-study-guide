# A. Theoretical Models of Disability

**Goal:** Characterize and Differentiate Between Theoretical Models of Disability, including the strengths and weaknesses of their underlying assumptions.

Theoretical models of disability provide perspectives and frameworks to understand disability. No model is comprehensive so can be neither fully correct nor incorrect.

In practice, organizations generally use aspects of multiple models, particularly the social and medical models.

* It's estimated that over 16% of people have disabilities - the world's largest (and growing) minority.


## 1. Medical Model
Considers disability as a health problem that affects individual people, and focuses on cure or management by professionals. It does not focus on society's responsibility for creating barriers, but instead focuses on disability as an individual's problem and on medical and health care.

### Strengths
* Recognizes how disability is a critical reality for some people
* Addresses biological/physical sources of disabilities

### Weaknesses
* Overlooks the social and political impacts of inaccessible environments
* Treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the individual, and can leave those with disabilities feeling excluded or undervalued

### Examples
* Glasses
* Hearing aids


## 2. Social Model
The social model is concerned with equal access, and views society as responsible for creating disability because it creates barriers. By the model, disability is not something an individual "has," but is something a person experiences. It puts the burden on community and society, not the disabled individual.

### Strengths
* Emphasizes that people with disabilities have the right to participate in society
* Focuses on disabling conditions/environments rather than disabled people

### Weaknesses
* Tends to downplay the biological reality of disability
* The push for social justice can put activists at odds with people with other political interests

### Examples
* Ramps and elevators for wheelchair accessibility
* A website designed to be screen reader friendly


## 3. Human Rights Model
*This model appears in the [2024 CPACC Preparation Course](https://iaap.edunext.io/courses/course-v1:IAAP+2024+2024/about).*

The human rights model states that people with disabilities have fundamental human rights, should be free from discrimination, and should be included in all matters that affect them. Responsibility is placed on governments.

### Strengths
* Was developed _with_ people with disabilities, and can guide government policy

### Examples
* 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights


## 4. Biopsychosocial Model
The Biopsychosocial Model of disability is an attempt to account for both the social and biomedical models of disability.
* Bio (physical/body)
* Psycho (thoughts, emotions, behaviors)
* Social (socio-economical, socio-environmental, and cultural factors)

### Strengths
* Promotes confidence, social support, and helps people with disabilities gain control
* Is helpful for rehabilitation, implementing a person's medical and social situation 

### Weaknesses
* Is more complex than other models which can cause confusion
* Might downplay the medical needs of people with disabilities

### Examples
* The option to turn camera off in a Zoom meeting
* Easy navigation through a hospital building for those who might be stressed or confused


## 5. Economic Model
The economic model defines disability by a person's ability or inability to work, and how much their impairment affects their productivity. It is used by policymakers in the context of determining and assessing disability benefits.

### Strengths
* Recognizes that disability affects a person's ability to work and they may need financial support or accomodations

### Weaknesses
* Creates a legally defined category of people who are "needy," which can lead to stigmatizing
* If a person doesn't meet the legal threshold for disability, they may not receive the support they need

### Examples
* A family qualifies for welfare since the parent stays home to care for a disabled child.
* A person with cognitive disabilities gets paid less than minimum wage.


## 6. Functional Solutions Model
Focuses on practical solutions and overcoming functional limitations for individuals. Most accessibility professionals work within this model.

### Strengths
* Results-oriented for people with disabilities

### Weaknesses
* Over-emphasis on technology/solutions can miss opportunities to address environmental or social barriers

### Examples
* Tools like screen readers, split keyboards, wheelchairs.


## 7. Social Identity/Cultural Affiliation Model
This model recognizes that disability may be a fundamental part of a person's identity.

### Strengths
* Disability is accepted and can be a point of pride, which can be affirming

### Weaknesses
* People who don't fit into the group's expectations can be alienated and groups can also alienate its members from society

### Examples
* Members of the Deaf community considers itself part of a culture with its own language and customs


## 8. Charity Model
The charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of outside help. It is related to the medical model, treating disability as an individual problem, and to the economic model in that it views disability in terms of the economic consequences to the individual.

### Strengths
* Can inspire people to contribute time/resources, and in some cases be the only source of funding for certain needs like to study extremely rare diseases

### Weaknesses
* Can be condescending toward people with disabilities
* Often focuses on short-term, immediate needs at the expense of more comprehensive and ultimately more effective long-term solutions

### Examples
* Telethons
* 5k Charity Runs
