# Neurological (Seizure) Disabilities

Impairments of the brain, spine, and nerves that connect them. 

## Migraine
A migraine is a vascular headache in which the blood vessels swell and cause pain. They can be triggered by a number of things including sleep changes, bright or flashing light, noise, computer use, stress, and certain foods.

### Demographics
Migraine is the world's second most common disability after back pain. An estimated 14-15% of the world's population experience migraines.

## Stroke
A stroke occurs when there is brain injury (temporary or lasting) from a blocked or burst blood vessel.

### Demographics
About 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke every year.

## Cerebral Palsy
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affects nervous system functions such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking.

### Demographics
About 17 million people worldwide have some form of cerebral palsy.

## Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disease where a person's immune system attacks the coating of their nerves, leading to potentially permanent nerve damage. Symptoms can include blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness, cognitive problems, an unsteady gait, and trouble speaking.

### Demographics
Around 2.8 million people worldwide live with MS.

## Seizure
A seizure is a sudden uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. If a person has two or more seizures or recurrent seizures, they have epilepsy. 

Depending on the type of seizure, symptoms can include:
* Visual hallucinations
* Inability to speak
* Convulsions
* Falling down
* Biting the tongue
* Loss of bladder/bowel control

### Demographics
Worldwide, about 65 million people (or 1 in 26) have seizure disorders.

## Photosensitive Epilepsy
Photosensitive epilepsy is a seizure disorder in which flashing or flickering lights or patterns can cause seizures. Lights that flash at 16 to 25 times a second are most likely to cause seizures, but some people are sensitive to rates as low as 3 or as high as 60 per second. 

### Demographics
About 5% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy.

# Common Barriers
* Technologies and spaces that present flashing/flickering lights or patterns (can trigger not just seizures but other conditions like migraines)
* Lack of space to recover from migraine or seizure
* Overly bright lights
* Misdiagnosis of migraines
