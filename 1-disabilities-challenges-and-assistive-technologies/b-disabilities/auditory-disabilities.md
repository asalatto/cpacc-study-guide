# Auditory Disabilities

## Deafness
Deafness is total or near total loss of hearing. 

Not all deaf people know sign language, but for some who are born deaf, it is their first/native language and they may feel less comfortable reading text because it's a second language for them. 

## Hard of Hearing
Refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe who still have some useful hearing. Most HoH people wear hearing aids.

## Demographics
According to the World Health organization, around 466 million people (~6% of the population) are deaf or hard of hearing.

# Common Barriers
* People speaking quietly or in large spaces without amplification
* Lack of sign language interpretation
* Loud environments with competing sounds
* Poor lighting which prevents lip reading
* Technologies that require listening for understanding or speaking for interacting
* Lack of captions or transcripts for audio/video, and media players that don't support captions, volume control, or formatting of captions
