# Auditory Disabilities

Auditory disabilities are sensory disabilities that range from partial to complete hearing loss.

## Deafness and Hard of Hearing

### Deafness
Deafness is total or near total loss of hearing. 

Not all deaf people know sign language, but for some who are born deaf, it is their first/native language and they may feel less comfortable reading text because it's a second language for them. 

### Hard of Hearing
Refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe who still have some useful hearing. Most HOH people wear hearing aids.

### Demographics
According to the World Health Organization, around 466 million people (~6% of the population) are deaf or hard of hearing.

According to the European Commission Knowledge Centre on Interpretation, 750,000 persons in the European Union use sign language as their first language.

## Central Auditory Processing Disorder

Auditory processing disorder (APD) is greater than expected difficulty hearing and understanding speech even though no measurable hearing loss exists. APD is not an inability to hear. Rather, it’s an inability to interpret, organize, or analyze what’s heard. The hearing pathway works well, but parts of the brain do not. 

People with APD can have difficulty locating the source of a sound, understanding what was said in loud environments, following spoken directions, learning songs or instruments, paying attention, responding promptly, or learning a new language. APD is often misdiagnosed as ADHD, language impairment, learning disabilities, or cognitive defects.

### Demographics
It is estimated that approximately 5% of the global population have Central Auditory Processing Disorder.


# Common Barriers
* People speaking quietly or in large spaces without amplification
* Lack of sign language interpretation
* Loud environments with competing sounds
* Poor lighting which prevents lip reading
* Technologies that require listening for understanding or speaking for interacting
* Lack of captions or transcripts for audio/video, and media players that don't support captions, volume control, or formatting of captions
