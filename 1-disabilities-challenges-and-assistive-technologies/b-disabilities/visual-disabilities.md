# Visual Disabilities

These are sensory disabilities that include: 
* some degree of vision loss
* loss of visual acuity
* increased/decreased sensitivity to specific or bright colors
* complete or uncorrectable loss of vision in one or both eyes

## Blindness
Blindness includes partial or total loss of vision. This includes people who are completely blind, or who can perceive light versus dark or the general shape of large objects.

### Demographics (World Health Organization)
* At least 33 million people are blind worldwide
* The leading causes of blindness are cataracts and glaucoma
* Most people who are blind are over 50 years old

## Color Vision Deficiency (Colorblindness)
Impairs a person's ability to distinguish certain color combinations. The most common type affects the perception of reds and greens.

### Demographics
* About 8% of men and 0.5% of women experience red-green colorblindness
* Fewer than 1 in 10,000 people experience blue-yellow colorblindness

## Low Vision
Permanently reduced vision that cannot be corrected with glasses, medicine, or surgery. People with low vision usually need magnification to read text or distinguish details.

Some people with low vision experience low contrast and need high contrast text/graphics. Some also experience color vision deficiencies. 

### Demographics
* ~246 million people, or 3.5% of the world population, have low vision
* ~90% of people with vision impairments live in low-income settings

# Common Barriers
* Print-only materials (books, menus, packages)
* GPS that is visual-only
* Low contrast text/images
* Websites that are not keyboard accessible
* Videos without text/audio alternatives or an audio description track
* Inadequate lighting
