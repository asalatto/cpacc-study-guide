# Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

Physical and mobility impairments cause limitations in the independent, purposeful physical movement of a person's body. These can be temporary or permanent and can be congenital, acquired with age, or caused by disease.

Mobility impairments include:
* Upper or lower limb loss/disability
* Challenges with manual dexterity
* Disability in coordination with different organs of the body
* Broken skeletal structure

The US Centers for Disease Control estimates that 11% of US adults have mobility disabilities.

## Manual Dexterity/Fine Motor Control
Fine motor skills are the movements of the hand/wrist needed to manipulate objects, as opposed to gross motor skills which allow for bigger movements. They are the result of coordinated efforts by the brain and muscles.

People with fine motor disabilities may have trouble with:
* Writing and drawing
* Using a keyboard
* Picking up and manipulating small objects
* Using both hands at the same time

## Ambulation
Ambulation is the ability to walk. Disabilities in this category can include the total inability to walk or difficulty with ambulation.

Impairments may be caused by:
* Congenital conditions (such as cerebral palsy or neuromuscular disorders)
* Amputation
* Arthritis
* Back injuries

## Muscle Fatigue
Muscle fatigue is a non-specific symptom characterized by progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. It can occur in any part of the body.

## Body Size or Shape
There are a variety of factors and disorders that can affect a person's stature, proportions, or shape. These include:
* Acromegaly (a condition that causes rapid growth)
* Dwarfism
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Obesity

# Common Barriers
* Seating that is too small or at the wrong height
* Steps, thresholds, and other obstacles to enter a space
* Counters, shelves, appliances, controls (etc) that are out of reach or require touch instead of voice commands
* Tables without knee or toe clearance
* Products and environments that require standing, fine motor skills, or strength
* Body shaming and social discrimination
