# Cognitive Disabilities

Cognitive disabilities are often hidden disabilities that affect a person's cognitive processes, ranging from mild to profound.

Cognitive processes are affected by both internal (impairments in mental functions) and external (information overload, stress, sleep deprivation) factors.

Mental functions used in cognitive processes include attention, memory, psychomotor, emotional, perceptual, thought, and calculation.


## Intellectual Disability
Significant limitations to intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem-solving).

The DSM-V establishes these criteria:
* IQ below 70-75
* Impairments in adaptive behavior (social and communication skills, skills needed to manage daily tasks, and skills needed to manage work or school)
* The condition manifests in childhood

The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities establishes these adaptive strategies that are impacted:
* Conceptual skills include language, reading, writing, managing time, managing numbers, reasoning, knowledge, memory
* Social skills include interpersonal skills, social judgment and responsibility, communication skills, the ability to follow rules and the ability to make and keep friendships
* Practical skills include the ability to perform tasks independently such as personal care, job responsibilities, setting up and following schedules, safety, travel and transportation, managing money, and organizing school and work tasks

### Demographics (Special Olympics)
An estimated 1-3% of the population, or about 200 million people, have intellectual disability.


## Reading Disability
Reading disabilities can include an inability to perceive text or process the meaning of words, phrases, and ideas. 

Possible causes include:
* Congenital differences
* Injury
* Delayed development
* Neurological or physical disability

### Dyslexia
Dyslexia affects a person's ability to read, despite having normal intelligence. It typically affects phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), spelling, and/or rapid visual verbal responding. 

Adult-onset dyslexia usually occurs because of brain injury or in the context of dementia. This contrasts with people with dyslexia who were never diagnosed as children or adolescents. Recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia.

### Demographics
An estimated 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, though the number can be as high as 17%. It is considered the most common language-based learning disabilities â€” 70-80% of those with reading difficulties are likely to have some form of it.


## Writing Disability
Dysgraphia is difficulty with writing and other fine motor skills, and can include expressing oneself in written language or drawing.


## Math and Computational Disability
Dyscalculia impairs a person's ability to learn and communicate mathematics. It may be congenital or result from injury, disease, or aging. This disability can be complicated by dysgraphia, an inability to draw or copy figures and graphs, and anxiety.

Examples include trouble with:
* Grasping the concepts of biggest vs smallest or quantities
* Understanding the connection between the number 5 and the word five
* Remembering math facts such as times tables, and understanding the logic of math
* Calculating money or making change
* Estimating time
* Judging speed or distance
* Remembering numbers when solving problems

### Demographics
An estimated 3-6% of people have dyscalculia.


## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD is a developmental problem with symptoms usually appearing by age 7. 

The DSM-V diagnostics criteria for ADHD is made up of two groups of symptoms: inattention/distraction and hyperactive/impulsive. Children diagnosed with ADHD must display 6 or more symptoms in one category. Adults diagnosed with ADHD must display 5 or more symptoms in either category.

Inattention/disctraction symptoms include: 
* Diminished attention span
* Distractability
* Difficulty starting, organizing, and finishing tasks
* Forgetfulness, losing items

Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms include:
* Feeling restless and having trouble controlling that sensation
* Fidgeting and having trouble sitting still
* Trouble waiting for one's turn
* Talking too much and interrupting

### Demographics
Between 2-7% of children are affected, and around 4% of adults.


## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
ASD refers to a range of complex brain developmental conditions resulting in sensory issues, challenges with communication and social interaction, and restricted and repetitive interests and activities. 

Autism manifests in childhood, often becoming apparent before age 5. It often has co-occurring conditions including epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. While some persons with autism may also have intellectual disabilities, others are of average to high intelligence and lead highly independent lives.

Asperger Syndrome is no longer a separate diagnosis but is classified as a form of autism spectrum disorder. 

People with ASD may have:
* Sensitivity to sound, smell, and light
* Difficulty with communication (verbal and non-verbal) including facial expressions, gestures, and language
* Difficulties understanding non-literal expressions
* Challenges in social interactions such as recognizing or expressing emotion, and feeling overwhelmed

### Demographics (Autism Europe)
Around 1 in 100 people have autism and its prevalence is increasing.


## Non-Verbal Learning Disability (NLD)
Like Aspergers Syndrome, people with NLD have normal intelligence and language development, but trouble with
social skills, sensory input, and making transitions. NLD is often considered a milder form of Aspergers.

Signs of NLD include:
* Excellent memory skills
* Great vocabulary and verbal expression
* Attention to detail but missing the big picture
* Concrete thinking and poor abstract reasoning
* Physical awkwardness and poor coordination
* Poor social skills
* Trouble adjusting to changes
* Anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem

### Demographics
Studies estimate that around 1 in 100, or 1%, of children in the United States may have NLD.


# Common Barriers

In the context of web accessibility, challenges include:
* Finding and understanding important information
* Remembering passwords
* Filling out forms
* Understanding and using controls
* Keeping focused
* Information overload caused by cluttered design or too many text elements
* Time-outs that cause stress and make it difficult to plan
