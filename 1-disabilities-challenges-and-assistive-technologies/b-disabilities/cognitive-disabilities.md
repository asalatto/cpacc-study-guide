# Cognitive Disabilities

Cognitive disabilities are often hidden disabilities that affect a person's cognitive processes, ranging from mild to profound.

Cognitive processes are affected by both internal (impairments in mental functions) and external (information overload, stress) factors.

## Intellectual Disability
Significant limitations to intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem-solving).

The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities establishes these criteria:
* IQ below 70-75
* Impairments in adaptive behavior (social and communication skills, skills needed to manage daily tasks, and skills needed to manage work or school)
* The condition manifests in childhood

### Demographics
An estimated 1-3% of the population, or about 200 million people, have intellectual disability.

## Reading Disability
Reading disabilities can include an inability to perceive text or process the meaning of words, phrases, and ideas. 

Possible causes include:
* Congenital differences
* Injury
* Delayed development
* Neurological or physical disability

### Dyslexia
Dyslexia is considered the most common language-based learning disabilities â€” 70-80% of those with reading difficulties are likely to have some form of it.

### Demographics
An estimated 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, though the number can be as high as 17%.

## Writing Disability
Dysgraphia is difficulty with writing and other fine motor skills, and can include expressing oneself in written language or drawing.

## Math and Computational Disability
Dyscalculia impairs a person's ability to understand mathematics. It may be congenital or result from injury, disease, or aging.

Examples include trouble with:
* Grasping the concepts of biggest vs smallest or quantities
* Understanding the connection between the number 5 and the word five
* Remembering math facts such as times tables, and understanding the logic of math
* Calculating money or making change
* Estimating time
* Judging speed or distance
* Remembering numbers when solving problems

### Demographics
An estimated 3-6% of people have dyscalculia.

## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD is a developmental problem with symptoms usually appearing by age 7.

Symptoms include: 
* Inattention
* Distractability
* Difficulty starting, organizing, and finishing tasks
* Forgetfulness 
* Feeling restless, fidgeting, difficulty staying seated or waiting for one's turn
* Talking too much and interrupting

### Demographics
Between 2-7% of children are affected, and around 4% of adults.

## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
ASD refers to a range of complex brain developmental conditions resulting in sensory issues and challenges with communication and social interaction. It begins in childhood, often becoming apparent before age 5, and often has co-occurring conditions including epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

People with ASD may have:
* Sensitivity to sound, smell, and light
* Difficulty with communication (verbal and non-verbal) including facial expressions, gestures, and language
* Challenges in social interactions such as recognizing or expressing emotion, and feeling overwhelmed

### Demographics
Around 1 in 100 people have autism and its prevalence is increasing.
