# Multiple or Compound Disabilities

People with complex disabilities often have simultaneous disabilities that, if severe enough, cannot be accomodated in a program that is just for one disability. 

These commonly include impaired speech and communication skills, impaired mobility, and needing help with daily tasks.

# Common Barriers
The person experiences barriers that apply to any and all of their disabilities. But compounding disabilities have these additional barriers:
* Barriers to education
* A lack of understanding of the complexity of a person's needs
* Social isolation or discrimination
