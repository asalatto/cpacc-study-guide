# Speech Disabilities

Speech disabilities range from mildly slurred speech to the physical inability to speak. This can be caused by underlying disabilities and can remain stable, worsen, or improve over time. It also doesn't necessarily affect a person's language capabilities (understanding, reading, and writing).

People with speech disabilities can have trouble with:
* Speaking to other people
* Understanding and remembering content without repeated exposure to it
* Writing understandable text
* Consistency and tone, stress, or rhythmn of speech

## Organic Speech Sound Disorders
These can be developmental or acquired. 

Motor/neurological: 
* Apraxia (the brain has difficulty planning the movements needed to speak)
* Dysarthria (person has difficulty controlling their speech muscles)

Structural:
* Orofacial abnormalities (cleft palate)
* Structural problems due to trauma or surgery

Sensory/perceptual:
* Hearing loss

## Functional Speech Sound Disorders
These have no known cause.

* Articulation (errors in producing clear and distinct sounds)
* Phonology (errors in correctly using sound patterns)

## Aphasia
Aphasia affects a person's ability to understand or produce speech, and results from neurological damage including head trauma, brain tumor, infection, or stroke. 

People with aphasia may be unable to form sentences or say what they mean; they may also not recognize words or understand what's being said.

## No Speech (Mutism)
Mutism can be caused by:
* Physical damage to the brain or speech muscles (neurogenic mutism)
* Emotional or psychological reasons (psychogenic mutism)
    * Elective mutism — a person chooses not to speak
    * Selective mutism — a person wants to but cannot speak, such as due to anxiety
    * Total mutism — a person does not speak at all
* A combination of other causes

# Common Barriers
* Not enough time to communicate, access information, or respond
* Lack of alternatives for speech communication
