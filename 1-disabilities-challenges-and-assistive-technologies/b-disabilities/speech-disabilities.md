# Speech Disabilities

Speech disorders specifically concern the way people say words and make sounds.

People with speech disabilities can have trouble with:
* Speaking to other people
* Understanding and remembering content without repeated exposure to it
* Writing understandable text
* Consistency and tone, stress, or rhythmn of speech

## Speech Sound Disorders

Speech sound disorders is an umbrella term for difficulties ranging from mild slurred speech to a complete inability to move the mouth to speak. This can be caused by underlying disabilities and can remain stable, worsen, or improve over time. 

It also doesn't necessarily affect a person's language capabilities (understanding, reading, and writing).

## Organic Speech Sound Disorders
These include disorders resulting from motor/neurological disorders and can be developmental or acquired.

Characteristics include slurred or slow speech, inconsistent speech errors, distorting sounds, or errors in tone, stress, and rhythm. 

Motor/neurological: 
* Apraxia (the person knows what they want to say, but the brain has difficulty planning the movements needed to speak)
* Dysarthria (person has difficulty controlling their speech muscles)

Structural:
* Orofacial abnormalities (cleft palate)
* Structural problems due to trauma or surgery

Sensory/perceptual:
* Hearing loss

## Functional Speech Sound Disorders
These do not stem from acquired or developmental disorders and have no known cause. 

* Articulation (errors in producing clear and distinct sounds)
* Phonology (errors in correctly using sound patterns)

Speech sound disorders statistics vary greatly due to inconsistencies in classifications and variations in the studied age groups. Prevalence is higher among children (5 to 25% depending on age group) than adults (1-2%).

## Aphasia
Aphasia affects a person's ability to understand or produce speech, and results from neurological damage including head trauma, brain tumor, infection, or stroke. 

Aphasia affects all use of language, not just speech. People with aphasia may be unable to form sentences or say what they mean; they may also not recognize words or understand what's being said.

Statistics from the National Aphasia Association state that there are at least 2 million people in the USA with aphasia,  at least 250,000 people in Great Britain, and the global incidence rate is currently unknown.

## No Speech (Mutism)
Mutism is the inability to speak. This can be caused by:

* Physical damage to the brain or speech muscles (neurogenic mutism)
* Emotional or psychological reasons (psychogenic mutism)
    * Elective mutism — a person chooses not to speak
    * Selective mutism — a person wants to but cannot speak in certain situations, such as due to anxiety
    * Total mutism — a person does not speak at all
* A combination of other causes

Selective mutism is estimated to affect 0.47% to 0.76% of the population. Statistics on
the incidence of neurogenic mutism are not available.


# Common Barriers
* Not enough time to communicate, access information, or respond
* Lack of alternatives for speech communication
* Lack of understanding and patience by persons when communicating
* Complex communication systems
