# Deaf-Blindness
Most people who are deaf-blind are neither completely deaf nor completely blind, and retain some ability to hear and see. 

Sensory inputs are limited to touch, smell, and taste, with touch being the only method for complex communication.

Deaf-blind people need to use braille (for text) and sign language (by feeling the hands of the person signing) to access conversations.

## Demographics
The incidence of deaf-blindness is low; according to the World Federation of the Deafblind, between 0.2% and 2% of the world's population is deaf-blind.

# Common Barriers
* Lack of braille on printed materials, or lack of output to a braille keyboard for digital/web technologies
* Lack of transcripts of video/audio materails 
* Lack of tactile sign language interpretation
