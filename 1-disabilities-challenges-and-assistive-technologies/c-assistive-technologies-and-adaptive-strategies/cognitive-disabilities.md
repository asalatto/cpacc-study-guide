# Cognitive Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

In general, adaptive strategies for cognitive impairments involve:
* Allowing adequate time to prepare for and complete tasks
* Checking for understanding and giving feedback in communications
* Minimizing distracting ambient noises
* Using plain language
* Providing structure and clear instructions

### Physical/Environmental
* Provide dimmable lighting
* Reduce ambient noise
* Make it easy to find things
* Provide large and easily understood signs
* Design routes that are simple and intuitive
* Wayfinding should be simple with easy to follow tactile, graphic, audible or architectural cues

### Digital
* Simplify content and carefully organize distraction-free interfaces
* Provide information through various means (text, audio, images)
* Allow adequate time to complete tasks (filling out a form, login sessions)
* Highlight most important information
* Customizable settings (for layout, content, time management)

## Assistive Technologies

### Attention and Focusing
* To-do lists
* Time management apps
* Productivity apps
* Computer-based prompting applications to assist with staying on task
* Ear plugs or noise-cancelling headphones

### Memory
* Reminders
* Audio prompting devices to assist with memory
* Auto-complete for web forms
* Password managers
* Audio note-takers and reminders
* Apps/technologies providing cues for actions

### Perceptual Functions
* Direction-finding applications

### Emotional Functions
* Apps for mindfulness and to reduce stress
* Apps for anxiety management and coping strategies
* Stim toys

### Reading and Writing
* Audiobooks and reading software
* Speech synthesizers/screen readers
* Word prediction/lookup
* Visual/audio alternatives to text in signs, messages, instructions
* Speech-recognition software

### Communication
* Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices
* Synchronized speech and highlighting
* Computerized voice output communication aids
* Computer-assisted instruction for word recognition, math, spelling, and social skills to be used in education
