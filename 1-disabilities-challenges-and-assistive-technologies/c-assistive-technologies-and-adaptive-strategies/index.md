# Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

**Goal:** Identify Appropriate Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies at the Level of the Individual for Permanent, Temporary and Episodic Disabilities (ICT and Physical World).

**Assistive technologies** are products, devices, systems, or items used by people with disabilities to perform tasks which they could not do otherwise. When they are used with computers, assistive technologies are also called adaptive technologies or adaptive software.

## Accomodations
**Accommodations** are modifications to goods, services, or environments so that a person with a disability can access and perform the same tasks as a person without a disability. These are protected by legislation (which varies by country). 

In general, an accomodation is not required if it places undue burden or hardship on the organization being asked to provide it. If an accommodation poses significant difficulty or expense, or if it requires a fundamental alteration to the essential nature of the goods, service, or environment, then the organization does not need to provide an accommodation.

Examples of accomodations:
* Captioning or ASL interpretation
* Materials in large print, digital format, or braille
* Extended time
* A ramp or elevator
* Working from home
* Assistive technologies
* Service animals

## Service Animals
Service animals are animals that are trained to support or perform tasks for people with sensory disabilities, a variety of diseases, and psychological disabilities.

Examples:
* Seeing-eye dogs to guide blind people
* Dogs that can detect seizures or drops in blood sugar levels
