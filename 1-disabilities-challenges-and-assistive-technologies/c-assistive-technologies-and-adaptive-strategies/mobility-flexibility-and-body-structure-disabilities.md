# Mobility, Flexibility and Body Structure Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

### Physical/Environmental

* Universal design with clearly defined, wide and unobstructed paths of travel
* Ergonomic design â€” the design of products, systems, and environments so that they fit people, allowing for greater access and use. Examples:
    * A vertical computer mouse
    * Handrails that are easy to grip
    * A shower with level access suitable for wheelchairs
    * A mirror that tilts to be usable when seated
* Ensure the environment provides ample space and objects have adequate size for use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility

### Digital
* Give clickable areas on a website/app enough size and space to target
* Ensure websites meet WCAG standards and work with assistive technologies

## Assistive Technologies

### Physical
* Wheelchairs and motorized scooters
* Walkers, canes, and crutches
* Prosthetics
* Exoskeletons
* Reachers

### Environmental
* Stair lifts
* Elevators
* Step ladders
* Grab bars, railing, and handle bars
* Taller, shorter, or wider chairs
* Large buttons, button hooks, and velcro closures

### Digital
* Switch devices to replace keyboard or mouse (buttons, sip-and-puff devices)
* Adaptive or customizable keyboards
* Oversized mice or trackballs
* Adjustable displays
* Eye-tracking control
* Bubble cursors
* Mouth sticks
* Head wands
