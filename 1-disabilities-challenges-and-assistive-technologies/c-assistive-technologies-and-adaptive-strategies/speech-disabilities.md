# Speech Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

### Physical/Environmental
* Simple communication methods
* Multiple options for communication
* Additional time to complete tasks
* Text-based alternatives to speech for communication
* Speech therapy

### Digital
* Text-to-speech software
* Adequate time to complete tasks

## Assistive Technologies
* Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices
* Spelling/grammar checkers
* Communication boards
* Word prediction software/features
* Text-based alternatives to speech such as writing and drawing

### Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices
AAC devices are designed for people who cannot use speech as their primary means of communication.

Most AAC devices fall into these categories:
* Single-meaning pictures (each picture represents a single word) — these are the simplest to use and don't require literacy
* Alphabet-based systems — these require basic literacy
* Semantic compaction (multi-meaning icons) — training is required for these devices, which involve short series of symbols per word
