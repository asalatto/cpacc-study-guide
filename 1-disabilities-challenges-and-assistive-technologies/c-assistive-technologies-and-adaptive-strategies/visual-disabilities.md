# Visual Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

### Physical/Environmental
* Raised tiles on the ground to indicate edges, pathways, stairs, etc
* Clear obstructions/obstacles
* Braille on signs and controls (although most blind people don't know braille)
* Tactile controls on flat devices such as microwaves and dishwashers
* Large print or magnifiers
* High contrast colors

### Digital
* Contextually-meaningful text alternatives for non-text information
* Design that allows for magnification
* High color contrast
* Not relying on color alone to express meaning
* Standard, consistent positioning and visual presentation of objects

## Assistive Technologies

### Physical & Sensory
* White canes (help people feel the environment as they walk)
* Service animals
* Refreshable braille displays
* Gesture input
* Haptic feedback

### Visual & Auditory
* Screen readers
* Screen magnifiers
* Audio description as an additional audio track
* Speech input/voice output
* Apps that can identify and describe objects, people, colors, or money values
* Color contrast adjusting software

### Screen Readers
A screen reader is a software that reads out text to a speech synthesizer or braille display. 

A person uses a screen reader by pressing combinations of keys on the keyboard or braille display. They typically include functions such as spelling, announcing which item is being focused on, and listing menus and headings.

* Popular screen readers include JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver (Apple), Narrator (Microsoft), and TalkBack (Android) 

### Refreshible Braille Display
A refreshible braille display raises and lowers pins in braille cells.

* Can typically show 80 characters at a time and changes as the user moves around the screen
* Price can range from $3,500-15,000

### Screen Magnifiers
Screen magnifiers allow users to select a portion of the screen and magnify it. They can be physical (attached to the computer monitor) or software.
