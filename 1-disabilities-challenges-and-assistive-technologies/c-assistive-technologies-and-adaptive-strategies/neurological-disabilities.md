## Adaptive Strategies

### Environmental
* Lowering lighting
* Avoidance of flashing/flickering light, patterns that give the illusion of movement, and loud sounds
* Providing a quiet, private space for recovery

### Digital
* Avoidance of flashing/flickering light, patterns that give the illusion of movement, and loud sounds
* Don't require computer games or VR for participation

## Assistive Technology
* Anti-glare glasses
* Ear plugs
* Supportive and protective gear in the event of falling
* Flicker-free monitors
* E ink monitors
