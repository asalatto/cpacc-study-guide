# Deaf-Blindness Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

### Physical/Environmental
* Tactile sign language & navigation aids
* Braille signage
* Printed material converted to braille

### Digital
* Information technology and content that meet accessibility standards
* Alternative text
* Audio and video transcripts
* Audio description

## Assistive Technologies
* Screen reader converting text to braille on a refreshable braille device
* Deaf-blind communicator
* Environment detecting wearables
* White cane (for feeling the environment)
* Service animals

### Haptics
Haptics use vibrations or other tactile sensations to support communication between people and computers, other electronic devices, and their environment. For example, setting your phone to vibrate.
