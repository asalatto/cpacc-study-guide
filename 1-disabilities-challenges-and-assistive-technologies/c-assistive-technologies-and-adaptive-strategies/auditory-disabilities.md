# Auditory Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Adaptive Strategies

### Physical/Environmental
* Use microphones in large spaces and ensure the space has good acoustics and lighting
* Provide sign language interpretation
* CART or STTR accurate & usable captions for videos, live online meetings, live presentations
* Reduce ambient noise
* Provide visual alerts like flashing lights for doorbells, alarms, and other alerts
* Clear signage for meeting rooms with microphones connected to audio induction loops

### Digital
* Captions/subtitles
* Audio transcripts
* Real time or live captioning (CART)
* Haptic alerts/feedback

## Assistive Technologies
* Hearing aids
* Cochlear implants
* TV amplifiers
* Hearing aid compatible telephones
* TTY: text telephone
* Texting apps
* Personal listening devices that connect to assistive listening systems (such as Frequency Modulation (FM) and hearing loop systems)
* Sound field systems (make a speaker's voice clearer)
* Noise canceling headphones

## Captions
Captions provide a synchronized text description of the audio and can be automatically or manually generated.

* **Closed captions** can be turned off
* **Open captions** are part of the video itself

Captions should include:
* all words spoken
* wordless vocalizations like laughter, coughs, and sighs
* important sound effects or environmental sounds

## Transcripts
Transcripts provide a text record of the audio in a separate text file. They typically only include a person's speech and not other relevant sounds.

## Audio Descriptions
Audio descriptions narrate a video's visual elements in the pauses between  dialogue, and supplement a regular audio track. These are especially useful for people with visual disabilities or who are deaf-blind.
