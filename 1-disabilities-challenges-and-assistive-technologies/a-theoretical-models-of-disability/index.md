# A. Theoretical Models of Disability

* It's estimated that over 16% of people have disabilities - the world's largest (and growing) minority.

## 1. Medical Model
Considers disability as a health problem that affects individual people, and focuses on cure or management. It does not focus on society's responsibility for creating barriers.

* Highlights how disability is a critical reality for some people and addresses biological/physical sources of disabilities. 
* But overlooks the social and political impacts of inaccessible environments, and can leave those with disabilities feeling excluded or undervalued.

Examples:
* Glasses
* Hearing aids

## 2. Social Model
Concerned with equal access, and views society as responsible for creating disability because it creates barriers - puts the burden on society, not the disabled individual.

* People with disabilities have the right to participate in society, and focuses on disabling conditions rather than disabled people.
* However, tends to downplay the biological reality of disability.

Examples:
* Ramps and elevators for wheelchair accessibility
* A website designed to be screen reader friendly

## 3. Human Rights Model
*This model appears in the [2024 CPACC Preparation Course](https://iaap.edunext.io/courses/course-v1:IAAP+2024+2024/about).*

People with disabilities have fundamental human rights, should be free from discrimination, and included in all matters that affect them. Responsibility is placed on governments.

* This model was developed _with_ people with disabilities, and can guide government policy

Examples:
* 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights

## 4. Biopsychosocial Model
Takes into account physical, psychological, and social context in which people with disabilities live.

* Promotes confidence, social support, and helps people with disabilities gain control.
* Is more universal, however it is more complex than other models which can cause confusion

Examples:
* The option to turn camera off in a Zoom meeting
* Easy navigation through a hospital building for those who might be stressed or confused

## 5. Economic Model
Defines disability by a person's ability or inability to work, and how much their impairment affects their productivity. 

* Recognizes that disability affects a person's ability to work and they may need financial support or accomodations.
* However, if a person doesn't meet the legal threshold for disability, they may not receive the support they need.

Examples:
* A family qualifies for welfare since the parent stays home to care for a disabled child.
* A person with cognitive disabilities gets paid less than minimum wage.

## 6. Functional Solutions Model
Focuses on practical solutions and overcoming functional limitations for individuals. **Most accessibility professionals work within this model.**

* Results-oriented for people with disabilities.
* However, this limits its use for addressing larger issues and can miss opportunities to address environmental or social barriers.

Examples: 
* Tools like screen readers, split keyboards, wheelchairs.

## 7. Social Identity/Cultural Affiliation Model
Recognizes that disability may be a fundamental part of a person's identity.

* Disability is accepted and can be a point of pride, which can be affirming.
* However, people who don't fit into the group's expectations can be alienated and groups can also alienate its members from society.

Examples:
* Members of the Deaf community considers itself part of a culture with its own language and customs

## 8. Charity Model
Regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of help.

* Can inspire people to contribute time/resources, and in some cases be the only source of funding for certain needs like to study extremely rare diseases.
* But people with disabilities can find this point of view offensive, and it can neglect more comprehensive and long-term solutions.

Examples:
* Telethons
* 5k Charity Runs
