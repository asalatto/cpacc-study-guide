# Apply Disability Etiquette into Practice

**Goal:** Describe and follow disability etiquette guidelines for interacting with people with disabilities. Judge the appropriateness of various ways of referring to or about people with disabilities.

Disability etiquette is a set of guidelines on how to respectfully interact with and communicate about people with disabilities, treat them with respect, and refer to them. 

* Put people first.
* Focus on the whole person, not attributes of their body.
* Ask people what their needs and preferences are.

## Inclusive Language

As awareness and inclusion improve, terminology evolves. It is important to avoid terms which are offensive and outdated, and to know whether someone with a disability prefers person-first or disability-first language.

### People-first Language

**People-first language** emphasizes the person, not the disability. Example: "a person with a disability" vs "a disabled person." People-first language is the form used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is also used in communications by G3ICT/IAAP in line with the UNCRPD.

### Identity-first Language

On the other hand, some people prefer to use **identity-first language** (in this case their disability) to refer to themselves. By placing their disability first, a person is indicating that it is a key part of their identity. Identity-first language is often used by self-advocates within disability communities. Examples: "A disabled person," "a Deaf person."

### Please ask!

When talking to or about a person with a disability, ask them which they prefer.

### Outdated and Offensive Terms

Example terms to avoid include:

* Handicapped
* Suffers from
* Invalid
* Crippled
* Deformed
* Brave
* Afflicted
* Inspiring

## General Guidelines

* DO speak directly to the person. DON'T interact with someone's assistant or service animal instead.
* DO offer assistance only if you've asked for permission and it's accepted. DON'T make assumptions that someone wants your help or take action without their request.
* DO treat people as individuals and adults as adults. DON'T make assumptions about what someone can or can't do.
* DO acknowledge someone's ability to make judgments and decisions on their own behalf. DON'T assume someone isn't capable.
* DO follow a disabled person's lead about discussing their disability, inquiring only about details they offer. DON'T ask personal or medical questions unless they bring it up first.
* DO your best to interact with the *person*, not the *disability*. DON'T worry about making mistakes - just ask.

## Guidelines - Interacting with People with Mobility Disabilities

* DO ask someone if they prefer that you sit or stand. DON'T touch or move someone's wheelchair or assistive device without permission (such devices are considered extensions of a person's body). 
* DO keep paths free of barriers. DON'T speak to someone's assistant instead of directly to them.

## Guidelines - Interacting with People with Visual Disabilities

* DO tell them who you are; introduce other people who are there, and say where they are. DON'T rely on facial expressions or gestures as a major part of your interaction.
* DO ask them if they wish to be warned about steps, doors, and other obstacles. DON'T touch their service animal without asking for permission. 
* DO say clearly where their seat is. DON'T grab a person to guide them — let them take your arm.
* DO feel free to use commmon sayings such as "see you tomorrow." DON'T speak to someone's assistant instead of them.

## Guidelines - Interacting with People with Hearing or Speech Disabilities

* DO position yourself in their vision and attract their attention with a light touch or a wave if needed. DON'T shout at people who are d/Deaf or have a hearing impairment.
* DO ask how a person wants to communicate — they may wish to lip-read, for example. DON'T assume they can't interact with you.
* DO speak at a normal pace and face a light source. DON'T cover your mouth or turn away while speaking.
* DO be patient with people with speech impairments. DON'T correct them or finish their sentences.
* DO ask them to repeat if necessary and tell them what you've understood so far. DON'T pretend to understand if you don't.

## Guidelines - Interacting with People with Cognitive and Neurological Disabilities

* (For cognitive) DO use language that is clear and concrete, and give the person time to respond. DON'T become impatient — repeat, speak more slowly, and clarify as needed.
* (For seizures) DO call an ambulance if a person has a seizure that lasts more than five minutes. DON'T restrain their movements or move the person.
* (For seizures) DO give the person time alone after a seizure, as they may be disoriented or embarrassed. DON'T give them anything to eat or drink until they've recovered.

## Guidelines - Interacting with People with Psychological Disabilities

* DO speak calmly, and offer to repeat information if the person is upset. DON'T assume the person can't handle stress.
* DO acknowledge the person’s feelings and express care and concern. DON'T blame someone for their feelings.
