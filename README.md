# CPACC Study Guide

This is meant to be my compilation of information and study materials for the [Certified Professional of Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) Exam](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional) offered by the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/).

The outline of this study guide is based off of the [CPACC Content Outline](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/cpacc-certification-content-outline) and the [October 2023 Body of Knowledge](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/CPACC_BoK_Oct2023).

This serves as a compilation of notes and research as I study the topics above and a reference for myself and anyone else studying to get certified.

## This is a work in progress! 

I'll be updating this guide as I learn and collect resources. At some point I'll share this and open it up to contributions but for now I'm only building out the skeleton.
