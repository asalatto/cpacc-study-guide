# Built Environment Accessibility

**Goal**: Identify and Apply Accessibility Principles for the Built Environment

The goal of universal design for the built environment is to ensure the accessibility of buildings, public spaces, and transportation systems.

The cost of *not* integrating universal design into the initial design and construction stages of a building is often greater than its overall construction cost.

Many countries have minimum building standards which must be met throughout the design and construction phases, but minimum standards often constitute _accommodation_ rather than _universal design_, which considers the needs of far more people.

Some areas of focus in built environment accessibility include:

* Access into and out of buildings (often connected to safety and evacuation)
* Moving around inside buildings, including:
    * accessibility and evacuation routes
    * fixtures and furnishings
    * accessibility of facilities
    * signage
* Transportation, including:
    * access to different means of transportation
    * routes
    * the outdoor environment
* Policies, guidelines, and recommendations
