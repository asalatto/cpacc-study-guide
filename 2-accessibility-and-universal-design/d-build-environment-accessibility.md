# Built Environment Accessibility

**Goal**: Identify and Apply Accessibility Principles for the Built Environment

The goal of universal design for the built environment is to ensure the accessibility of buildings, public spaces, and transportation systems.

The cost of *not* integrating universal design into the initial design and construction stages of a building is often greater than its overall construction cost.

Some areas of focus in built environment accessibility include:

* Access into and out of buildings.
* Inside buildings, including:
    * movement and evacuation
    * fixtures and furnishings
    * accessibility of facilities
    * signage
* Transportation, including:
    * access to different means of transportation
    * routes
    * the outdoor environment
* Policies, guidelines, and recommendations.
