# Web Accessibility

**Goal**: Understand the basic concepts of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Know the Guidelines’ four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

**Web accessibility** is the ability of a website to be easily navigated, used, and understood by people with disabilities. It combines web development and file creation standards with universal design practices. It allows people with disabilities to perceive, navigate, understand, interact, and contribute to the web.

Web accessibility also benefits:
* People without disabilities, such as those in a noisy or bright environment, with a temporary/situation disability, with a slow internet connection or bandwidth, and using a variety of different devices/interfaces.
* Website findability/SEO. Well-structured content and accurate page titles and headings help search engines correctly index webpages.
* Better usability — user-centered design is good design, and benefits everyone, regardless of ability. 

## WCAG — Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

WCAG standards are created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) through its Web Accessibility Initiative. The most current version is WCAG 2.2, but WCAG 2.0 remains approved as ISO standard ISO/IEC 40500.

## WCAG Principles

* **P**erceivable
* **O**perable
* **U**nderstandable
* **R**obust

### Levels of the WCAG

The success criteria are categorized into three levels:

* A: Minimal accessibility.
* AA ("double A"): Accessibility for most people. Most commonly used.
* AAA ("triple A"): Highest level of accessibility.
 
### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive.

* Provide text alternatives for non-text content.
* Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.
* Create content that can be presented in different ways (including by assistive technologies) without losing meaning.
* Make it easier for users to see and hear content.

### Operable

Users must be able to operate the interface and it cannot require an interact that a user can't perform.

* Make all functionality keyboard-accessible.
* Make it easier to use inputs other than a keyboard.
* Give users ample time to read and use content.
* Help users find and navigate content.
* Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions.

### Understandable

Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface.

* Make text readable and understandable.
* Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.
* Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

### Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. As technologies and users' tools evolve, the content should remain accessible.

* Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.
* Correctly identify the name, role, and value of elements so they can be used by current and upcoming technologies.
