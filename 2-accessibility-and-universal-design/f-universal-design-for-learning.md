# Universal Design for Learning

**Goal**: Identify and Apply Principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

Universal design for learning (UDL) provides a framework for teaching that considers the diverse needs of learners. It asks teachers to provide **variety** in: presenting information, engaging learners, and how learners demonstrate their knowledge.

3 principles of universal design for learning:
* **Provide multiple means of engagement** — use the brain's affective networks and address the "why" of learning.
* **Provide multiple means of representation** — use the recognition networks and address the "what" of learning.
* **Provide multiple means of action and expression** — use the strategic networks and address the "how" of learning.

## Principle 1: Multiple means of engagement

Learners may have different styles of engagement - for example, one might prefer routine and another might prefer spontaneity while learning. Providing multiple means of engagement means teaching in a wide range of styles that can capture the most amount of engagement (or motivation and excitement), tapping into the mind's three broad learning networks:

* Caring and prioritizing (why am I learning this?)
* Recognition (what am I learning?)
* Skills and strategies (how can I learn this and show that I understand?)

For students to be enthusiastic about learning, and gain knowledge and skills, learning activities must be designed to help them do all three.

Teachers should provide options to:
* Spark excitement and curiosity for learning
* Tackle challenges with focus and determination
* Harness the power of emotions and motivation in learning

Examples:
* A choice of tasks so learners can focus on the challenges that interest them
* Culturally and socially relevant activities
* Activities that encourage self-reflection

## Principle 2: Multiple means of representation

The mind's recognition network helps learners perceive and make sense of the information being taught. Those with disabilities or language or cultural differences in particular may need different ways of learning the information.

Teachers should provide options for:
* Information, so it doesn't depend on a single sense (sight, hearing, movement, or touch)
* Communicating in ways that create a shared understanding
* Supporting comprehension

## Principle 3: Multiple means of action and expression

This principle taps into the skills and strategies network, and helps learners navigate the learning environment and express what they know.

Teachers should provide options for:
* Accessible materials and tools
* Creating and sharing ideas using tools that help attain learning goals
* Developing and acting on plans to make the most of learning

Examples:
* Multiple examples of novel solutions to a problem
* Posting learning goals, objectives, and schedules
* Providing options for students to show they understand a topic, for example by writing an article or by giving a presentation
