# User-Centered and Universal Design

**Goal**: Distinguish Between Individualized Accommodations (Solutions Designed Only for Exceptional Individuals, to Make Up for Shortcomings in the Main Design) and Universal Design (Items or Environments Designed to be Used by a Wide Range of Individuals with Diverse Abilities)

## Universal Design

A key concept of **universal design** is that a product or service is developed in a way that as many people as possible can use it without needing adaptations.

By contrast, **reasonable accommodations** are specific modifications and adjustments made to an environment, product or service to ensure equal access and opportunity for people with disabilities in a specific case.

Also known as: inclusive design, design for all, human-centered design, life-span design

### User-Centered Design

User-centered design is an iterative process that puts people at the center of the design of products, services, and environments. The key goal of user-centered design is to understand users and the context in which they will use the product (such as in low light or sitting down), in order to create products that are highly usable and accessible.

The four phases of user-centered design include:

* Understand the users and their context.
* Identify user and business requirements.
* Design a solution.
* Evaluate the solution against the context and requirements.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is about designing so that that people with disabilities have an equivalent user experience without barriers or discrimination. **Products should be usable by everyone.** 

The most effective ways to create accessible products are to:

* Incorporate real (not theoretical) people in the design.
* Ensure everyone on the project understands the needs of people with disabilities.
* Involve people with disabilities in every stage of the research, design, and testing.
* Follow standards (such as WCAG from websites and information technology, and ISO 21542 for built environments).
* Have users with disabilities evaluate accessibility.


## User Experience

User experience is concerned with the **entire journey** a person has with a product. It addresses every point of interaction a person has with it over time, including:

* Becoming aware of the product.
* Acquiring or accessing it.
* Using it for the first time.
* Using it subsequent times.
* Their feelings about it.

Core areas of the user experience include:
* Usability: a measure of a userâ€™s ability to arrive on a site, use it easily, and complete the desired task.
* Useful Content: The website should include enough information in an easily digestible format so that users can make informed decisions.
* Desirable/Pleasurable Content: The best user experiences come when the user can form an emotional bond with the product or website.
* Accessibility: There are a set of accessibility standards sites should conform to in order to be used by people with disabilities.
* Credibility: The trust (levels of security and privacy) that a website engenders in users also plays a part in the user experience.

## Usability

Usability focuses on ease of use and user experience, but does not always consider the needs of people with disabilities. It's a sub-discipline of user experience design. 

* An interface should be **easy to use**.
* The design should make it **easy for people to achieve their goal**.
* An interface should be **easy to learn** so using it again is even easier.

A highly usable product **reduces cognitive load**, or the effort needed to think. Some ways of reducing cognitive load are:

* Providing only as much information as needed.
* Using clear language.
* Eliminating distractions.
* Simplifying the environment or user interface.
* Conducting user research to understand the target audience.
* Following accessibility and universal design standards.
