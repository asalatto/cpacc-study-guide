# Benefits of Accessibility

**Goal**: Describe how accessibility benefits people with disabilities as well as organizations and society.

## Personal and Societal Benefits of Accessibility

Accessibility benefits everyone â€” individuals with or without disability, organizations, and society.

These are some benefits for people with disabilities and their family:

* People are not isolated or hidden from society.
* Inclusion allows people with disabilities to participate in society and be valued as full citizens.
* Increased opportunities for employment lead to greater family income and wealth potential.
* Access to child care and education creates more opportunities and helps break the cycle of poverty.

The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) also identifies the following benefits to society:

* Increased independence strengthens society. Technologies that welcome everyone, everywhere, send a powerful message to each individual that we are all connected.
* Society benefits economically. People who are more independent benefit the economy of a country in many ways: increasing the participation of people with disabilities in the workforce leads to an increase in taxpayers and decrease in support costs. The increasing availability of assistive technologies reduces the societal cost of lower productivity.

## Business Benefits of Accessibility

"Business" here refers to any type of organization, including commercial, educational, non-profit, and governmental. According to the W3C's article "The Business Case for Digital Accessibility," there is a strong business case for accessibility.

* **Accessibility drives innovation.** Integrating accessibility removes architectural, digital, and social barriers that can get in the way of innovation. For example:
    * Driverless cars benefit blind people *and* might address traffic congestion or fatalities.
    * Research and development of the artificial retina project to help restore sight for participants who are blind may also help future robots with real-time image processing systems, effectively allowing them to "see."
* **Accessibility enhances brand.** A clear commitment to accessibility can demonstrate that a business has a genuine sense of corporate social responsibility, which can lead to enhanced reputation, increased sales and brand loyalty, and improved workforce diversity.
* **Accessibility increases market reach.** A large segment of the population has a disability, and this number grows as the population ages. And as accessibility features are added to products, overall customer satisfaction improves. For those with disabilities, accessibility features are *essential* for equal access, but often all users can benefits. For example:
    * People using mobile phones, smartwatches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens and different input modes.
    * People with temporary/situational disabilities such as a broken arm or lost glasses.
    * Challenging situations such as bright sunlight or noisy environments.
* **Accessibility minimizes legal risk.** With legal risks increasing, smart businesses, particularly those with global activities, are creating accessibility policies and programs to mitigate risk to protect both their assets and their reputations.
