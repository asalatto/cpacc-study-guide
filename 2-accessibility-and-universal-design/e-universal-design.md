# Universal Design

**Goal**: Identify and Apply Principles of Universal Design.

The goal of **universal design** is to create products, services, and environments that meet the needs of *everyone* who uses them, minimizing or eliminating the need for adaptations or accommodations.

A good example is a fire alarm, which produces a loud sound *and* flashing lights for those who are deaf. In addition, it should produce haptic feedback or text messages.

Universal design is also known as:
* inclusive design
* design for all
* human-centered design
* lifespan design

## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use

The design should be useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

* Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible, equivalent when not.
* Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
* Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.
* Make the design appealing to all users.

Examples:
* Curb cuts in sidewalks
* Automatic doors
* Closed captioning
* High contrast text

### 2. Flexibility in Use

The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

* Provide choice in methods of use.
* Accommodate right or left-handed access and use.
* Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
* Provide adaptability to the user's pace.

Examples:
* Ambidextrous scissors
* Moving walkways at airports
* Customizable dashboards
* A form with generous time to complete

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use

The use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

* Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
* Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
* Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
* Arrange information consistent with its importance.

Examples:

* A cup with a handle
* IKEA picture-based instructions
* Consistent navigation elements on a website
* Content written in plain language

### 4. Perceptible Information

The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.

* Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
* Provide adequate contrast between essential information.
* Differentiate elements in ways that can be described.
* Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.

Examples:
* Redundant cueing in airports (communication and signange)
* Credit/debit cards with cutouts to indicate which is which
* Alternative text on images
* Adequate color contrast

### 5. Tolerance for Error

The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

* Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors.
* Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
* Provide fail-safe features.
* Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.

Examples:
* Double-cut keys which can be inserted into keyholes either way
* Power tools that prevent injuries
* Allowing for review and correction before submitting a form
* Using date pickers to ensure proper date formatting 

### 6. Low Physical Effort

The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

* Allow the user to maintain a neutral body position.
* Use reasonable operating forces.
* Minimize repetitive actions.

Examples:
* Lever or loop handles for doors or faucets
* Touch lamps operated without a switch
* Voice activation
* Keyboard shortcuts

### 7. Size and Approach for Use

Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user’s body size, posture, or mobility.

* Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.
* Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
* Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.
* Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.

Examples:
* Wide gates at subway stations
* ATMs at a reachable height for people using wheelchairs
* Large targets areas for buttons on mobile apps
* A website that visually highlights the most important information
